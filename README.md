# Shark-Tank-S01-Data-analysis
Made a project to compile and analyse data from Shark Tank Season 01 by extracting information from                Wikipedia and other sources, organizing it in Excel, and importing it into MS SQL. Utilized advanced SQL functions like Rank (), Partition by, dense_rank (), Row_number (), Running sum, and row between for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
